# 379_388_397_399_Microservices-communication-using-RabbitMQ

The inventory management system aims to efficiently manage inventory
items, track stock levels, and handle orders through a microservices architecture. The system will utilize RabbitMQ
for inter-service communication and Docker for containerisation, ensuring scalability, modularity, and ease of
deployment.

#1. Scalable Architecture: Design a microservices architecture that allows independent development,
deployment, and scaling of each component.

#2. Robust Communication: Implement communication between microservices using RabbitMQ queues to
ensure reliable message passing.

#3. Functional Microservices: Develop microservices to handle specific tasks such as health checks, item
creation, stock management, and order processing.

#4. Database Integration: Integrate a database service to store inventory data and ensure proper CRUD
operations.

#5. Containerization: Containerize the application using Docker to provide consistency and portability across
different environments.

#6. Testing and Documentation: Conduct thorough testing to ensure the system functions as expected and
provide comprehensive documentation for setup, usage, and maintenance.
